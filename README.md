# Cloud-Resume

In development: static website frontend for the Cloud Resume challenge.

TODO:
- [x] Finish static website's design
- [x] Host static website on S3, get a CloudFront distribution
- [ ] Use API Backend to count visitors (maybe API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB ?)
- [ ] Get a domain name
- [x] Use Github Actions to automatically update website when new pushes occur in the repository
- [ ] Write my process over the development of this project, with the reasoning for each decision
