# Cloud-Resume

In development: static website for the Cloud Resume challenge.

TODO:
- [ ] Finish static website
- [ ] Host static website on S3, get a CloudFront distribution
- [ ] Use API Backend to count visitors (maybe API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB ?)
- [ ] Buy domain name
- [ ] Use Github Actions (?) to automatically update website when new pushes occur in the repository
- [ ] Write my process over the development of this project, with the reasoning for each decision
