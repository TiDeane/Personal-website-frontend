# Cloud-Resume

In development: my attempt at the Cloud Resume challenge.

TODO:
- [ ] Finish static website
- [ ] Host static website on S3, get a CloudFront distribution
- [ ] Use API Backend to count visitors (maybe API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB ?)
- [ ] Use Github Actions (?) to automatically update website when new push occur in the repository
